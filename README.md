### Todo app


### Description:

A todo app used to track stuff with super minimalistic design.


### Built with:

- Nodejs (TypeScript, Express)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript


### Motivation:

This is a learning project, the goal is to build a full stack CRUD app without using any frameworks. 

After 2.5 years of working, it feels almost impossible to think in anything but frameworks and internal tools. So I decided to get away from all that and re-visit the basics for a bit with this project, and what better way to do that than a simple yet useful todo app!
