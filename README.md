### TaskZen 

A full stack task tracking app.


### Technologies:

- ```HTML```, ```CSS```, ```JavaScript```
- ```Nodejs``` (```TypeScript```, ```Express```)
- ```PostgreSQL```


### Motivation:

Don't use any frameworks to build a professional CRUD app

Style is inspired by my favourite productivity tool Notion :)

After around 2.5 years of working I felt like I got too used to thinking about everything in frameworks and internal tools, and found it difficult to apply that knowlegde elsewhere. So for this project I wanted to revisit the fundamentals of web development. I chose a simple todo app for this cos I didn't want to focus too much on cool functionality/features but rather the overall architecture of a web app, from an index.html file to a finished application on the internet.
