### Todo app

A full stack Todo App


### Built with:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Nodejs (TypeScript, Express)
- PostgreSQL


### Motivation:

This is a learning project, the goal was to build a full stack CRUD app without using any frameworks.

After 2.5 years of working, it feels almost impossible to think in anything but frameworks and internal tools. So I wanted to get away from all that for a bit and re-visit the details and fundamentals with this project, and what better way to do that than a simple and useful todo app!
