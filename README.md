### TaskZen 

A full stack task tracking app.


### Technologies:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Nodejs (TypeScript, Express)
- PostgreSQL


### Motivation:

To build a professional full stack web app (CRUD) without using any frameworks.

Style is inspired by my favourite productivity tool Notion.

After 2.5 years of working, it felt hard to think in anything but frameworks and internal tools. I wanted to get away from all that for this project and re-visit the details and fundamentals of web development, and what better way to do that than a simple and useful to-do style app!
