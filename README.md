### Todo app

A full stack Todo App, style inspired by Notion


### Built with:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Nodejs (TypeScript, Express)
- PostgreSQL


### Motivation:

This is a learning project, the goal was to build a full stack CRUD app without using any frameworks (and also make it look nice).

After 2.5 years of working, it feels almost impossible to think in anything but frameworks and internal tools. So I wanted to get away from all that for a bit and re-visit the details and fundamentals with this project, and what better way to do that than a simple and useful todo app!
